## Dev Template

```sh
dt --template mvc
```

No more installing and configuring all basic dependencies manually every time you start a new project. the [dev template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dev-template) can install and configure everything with a single command. A CLI that runs templates with a sequence of commands to launch your projects. Anyone (including you) can create a template that will install and run the commands needed to start your projects.
